# StandardLicensingGenerator

A Windows desktop tool for generating licenses compatible with the [Standard.Licensing](https://github.com/dnauck/Standard.Licensing) library. The application lets you configure all available license options, sign them with your private key and save the result for distribution.

## Features

- Create **Standard**, **Trial** license types
- Set product name, version, and expiration date
- Store customer information (name and email)
- Add any additional attributes using JSON
- Sign licenses using your own RSA private key
- Save generated licenses to a file
- Built-in help screen describing how to use the tool

The UI is designed with sensible defaults and labeled inputs so generating a license only requires filling in the desired fields and selecting your private key.

## Usage

1. Start the application.
2. Enter your product details and customer information.
3. Select the desired license type and expiration date.
4. Optionally add extra attributes in JSON format (e.g. `{ "Seats": "5" }`).
5. Browse to your private key file. PEM keys are recommended, but existing XML keys are also supported.
   Keys must be unencrypted; passphrase-protected keys are not currently supported.
6. Click **Generate License** to view the resulting license text.
7. Use **File â†’ Save License** to store the license in a `.lic` file.

The generated license can then be validated in your application using the matching public key with the Standard.Licensing library.

# Using Licenses in Your Software

This guide describes how to incorporate license validation, import, updating, and management features using the output from StandardLicensingGenerator and the [Standard.Licensing](https://github.com/dnauck/Standard.Licensing) library.

## 1. License Validation

To ensure a user holds a valid license for your application:

- **Load** the license file (e.g. `license.lic`) at application startup or before accessing protected features.
- **Validate** the license signature using your embedded or distributed public key.
- **Check** license properties: expiration dates, allowed features, seat counts, or custom attributes.

Example (pseudocode):
```csharp 
// C# var licenseText = File.ReadAllText("path/to/license.lic"); var license = License.Load(licenseText);
var publicKey = "..."; // Your PEM or XML public key string or file content
if (!license.VerifySignature(publicKey)) { // Invalid license throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("License verification failed."); }
if (license.Type == LicenseType.Trial && license.Expiration < DateTime.Now) { // License has expired throw new LicenseExpiredException(); }
// Access license attributes var customerName = license.Customer.Name; var seats = license.AdditionalAttributes.Get("Seats");
```
## 2. License Import

Allow users to import their license file into your software:

- Provide a UI for selecting or drag-and-dropping a license file.
- Store the selected license, for example in the user's application data folder.
- Trigger validation immediately after import.

Recommended steps:

- Validate the imported license signature.
- Optionally, inform the user about license details (customer, type, expiration).

## 3. Updating a License

To support changes such as upgrading, extending, or modifying user licenses:

- Allow users to **replace** their license by importing a new file.
- Overwrite the previously stored license.
- Offer a menu or command for "Update License."
- Display relevant license status (valid/expired/type) in your application's settings or about dialog.

## 4. Handling License States

- **Valid License**: Grant access to features as described by the license attributes.
- **Expired or Invalid License**: Restrict access or show an appropriate message.
- **No License**: Prompt the user to enter/import a valid license.

## 5. Licensing Security Best Practices

- Always perform license validation on application start and before providing critical functionality.
- Protect your public key: embed it in your application resources, not as plain text or in a writable location.
- Never ship your private key with your distribution.

## 6. License Attributes and Customization

- Use custom attributes to define seats, editions, enabled modules, etc.
- Document any custom license properties your software consumes.

## 7. Revocation and Renewal (Optional)

If your workflow supports revocation or renewal:

- Let users load a replacement license file with new terms or updated validity.
- For revocation, consider maintaining a list of revoked license IDs within your app or via online lookup (optional, requires networking).

## Distribution

The project targets `net9.0-windows` and can be published as a single-file executable for easy distribution (e.g. via web download). Run:

```PowerShell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```
to produce a distributable package.

## Help

A help window is available from the **Help** menu inside the application. It provides a short overview of the workflow and explains where to place your private/public keys.
