To use custom icons instead of system icons, add the following files to the Resources folder:

- error.png
- warning.png
- info.png
- question.png

Recommended size: 32x32 pixels with a transparent background.

When these files are present, the CustomMessageBox will use them instead of system icons.
If the files are not found, it will automatically fall back to system icons.
